They offer free, long-term courses called Pathways that have projects and tutorials, while also allowing users to track their progress and attend live-learning sessions led by industry specialists. The value proposition of their platform was to help users develop employable Unity skills while understanding Unity’s capabilities.<br/><br/>Unity Learn defined their primary goal to be improving long-term engagement and lessen pain points from their platform. From surveys and feedback forms, they were aware of their platform’s short retention rate.</div></div><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">What&#x27;d we do?</h1><div class="text-block">During this project, our team conducted user research and testing to come up with data-led recommendations. Due to our time restraint, we prioritized spending more time on testing and basic mockups rather than spreading ourselves thin to create last minute prototypes.</div></div><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Target audience</h1><div class="text-block">From our client’s existing data, we found 3 potential target audiences:</div><ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item">senior students/early career professionals with basic knowledge of Unity</li><li>intermediate users looking to develop a specific and specialized understanding of Unity</li><li>young professionals looking to leverage unity to build a career.</li></ul><div class="text-block">To narrow down our scope, we decided to work with the senior students/early career professionals for our study.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="project-section"><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="project-section-header"><div class="project-context-div"><h1 class="heading-3-blue">OUR APPROACH</h1></div><div class="line-blue"></div></div><div class="project-content"><div class="text-block">Based on our client’s goals, our team created a 3-week long study comprised of user testing, analysis, and recommendations to Unity.</div><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Study goals</h1><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Site navigation</p><div class="text-block">The existing CTA for user engagement is to navigate and engage in a Pathway. We wanted to understand how users viewed the existing site navigation and their habits.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Self-learning process</p><div class="text-block">Since Unity Learn aims to help with professional development, we wanted to explore how users evaluated their development and how they interacted with the platform’s progress tracking features.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Ease of use</p><div class="text-block">Since Pathways caters to novice and returning users of Unity, we dove deep into their respective needs and habits during different parts of their learning journey.</div></div></div><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Next steps</h1><div class="text-block">With our study goals in mind, we created an initial study proposal. Prior to working with interviewees, we ran through a pilot study with a colleague. We found the initial study took a lot of time which would likely contribute to fatigue and disinterest from the participants. We removed some tasks and questions (like our post-test Likert Scale questionnaire), which provided quantitative information less relevant to our study goals.</div></div><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Study composition</h1><div class="text-block">Each interview was completed in three parts, with one participant and two researchers over an hour-long Zoom video call. After refining our study, this is what it comprised of.</div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Pre-test</p><div class="text-block">We discussed and recorded the participant&#x27;s Unity experience level, how they use Unity, and other background questions to understand how they could affect results.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Think-aloud usability test</p><div class="text-block">Participants were asked to think-aloud while completing tasks on various Unity Learn webpages, including onboarding and Pathways modules.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Post-test</p><div class="text-block">We asked participants to evaluate their overall experience on the site navigation and learning experience through a series of questions.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="project-content"><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Limitations</h1><div class="text-block">Due to the limited length of our study period, the long-term effects of using Unity Learn was difficult to study. Participants were also unable to complete more than 1-2 courses during our hour-long session times. Thus, we narrowed the scope to focus more on alleviating pain points.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="project-section"><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="project-section-header"><div class="project-context-div"><h1 class="heading-3-blue">ANALySIS</h1></div><div class="line-blue"></div></div><div class="project-content"><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Sorting our data</h1><div class="text-block">We analyzed our findings with an affinity diagram created in Miro, which detailed the answers or experiences each participant had on the website into sticky notes. <br/><br/>Based on this data, we organized the affinity diagram into two main categories: platform features (content, information, offerings) and interface design (site navigation, content organization). <br/><br/>With the significant data collected, they were further split into subcategories:</div><ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item">features</li><li>language</li><li>excessive/missing information</li><li>site navigation</li><li>and more</li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><section class="project-section"><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="project-section-header"><div class="project-context-div"><h1 class="heading-3-blue">OUR RESULTS</h1></div><div class="line-blue"></div></div><div class="project-content"><div class="text-block">The overarching topics participants discussed about Unity Learn was related to the content, and interface.</div><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Content</h1><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Features</p><div class="text-block">Participants provided positive feedback on the Pathways programs. They found the content hierarchy easy to digest.<br/><br/>They also liked being able to track their personal development progress, and the gamification of earning XP (experience points) for completing lessons.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Language &amp; content</p><div class="text-block">Unity-specific language made navigation difficult for novice users. Essential terms to the platform about gamified features, expertise level, and other industry jargon were confusing. This was shown when participants were confused by the complex terms in the search filters when browsing through courses, as well as when trying to understand the XP system.<br/><br/>There was also media content throughout the site that was mismatched to the content it was paired with.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Interface design</h1><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Site navigation</p><div class="text-block">Users were confused about the difference between the homepage and My Learning pages since they had overlapping content and features. <br/><br/>For some pages, there were mismatched expectations when users interacted with buttons and menus. For example, some buttons looked like dropdowns for additional information, but would instead lead to a generic webpage on finding new tutorials.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Content organization</p><div class="text-block">Participants found the homepage’s hierarchy for information blocks were organized in an unnatural way. User-catered recommendations were mixed with non-catered sections; for example, featured banners about the latest courses would be placed alongside ones’ personal learning progress.<br/><br/>On the browse page, users found that they were unable to remove or reset their search filters.<br/><br/>Finally, in the live learning section, there was a common consensus from participants that the live course offerings had confusing visual design and hierarchy. It was hard to differentiate whether they were different lessons within a series of lectures, or multiple sessions for the same lesson.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="project-section"><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="project-section-header"><div class="project-context-div"><h1 class="heading-3-blue">DESIGN SOLUTION</h1></div><div class="line-blue"></div></div><div class="project-content"><div class="heading-text-block"><h1 class="heading-2-extra-dark-grey">Our recommendations</h1><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Approachable language and support</p><div class="text-block">Unity Learn&#x27;s content utilizes industry and platform-specific lingo, which can be daunting to newer users. They can be provided with additional help through easier language and/or contextual support.<br/><br/>The use of pop-ups, tooltips, and reminder descriptions throughout the platform can allows users to gain a better understanding of the language used, and feel more inclined to stay on the platform.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Changes to the homepage</p><div class="text-block">With the confusion in overlapping or similarly styled features between the personal homepage and My Learning pages, we proposed a reorganization of information architecture on the two pages.<br/><br/>In our new site architecture, we recommend keeping announcements and less catered offerings strictly on the homepage. We also suggested minimal personal progress statistics, and instead have a large CTA to visit the learning dashboard.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Adjusting the My Learning page</p><div class="text-block">The My Learning page should be changed to focus solely on progress and understanding the users have developed, and include tooltips to help users understand different parts of the progress tracker.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Adjusted search filters</p><div class="text-block">We also suggested rearranging the order of the search filters on the browse page based on perceived importance by participants. A ‘clear all filters’ buttons should also be added for an intuitive interface.</div></div><div class="subheading-text-block"><p class="subheading-1-bold">Visual hierarchy for live learning</p><div class="text-block">Our last recommendation was to create more visual hierarchy on the Live Learning page to separate sessions, and series-based courses by separating them into their respective topics.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="project-section"><div class="w-layout-grid project-section-grid"><div class="project-section-div"><div class="project-section-header"><div class="project-context-div"><h1 class="heading-3-blue">REFLECTION</h1></div><div class="line-blue"></div></div><div class="project-content"><div class="heading-text-block"><div class="text-block">We faced many obstacles:</div><ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item">changed clients 3 weeks into the project</li><li>struggled to find suitable candidates for interviews</li><li>worked against a time crunch due to an upcoming revamp to the website set to released after our case study</li></ul><div class="text-block">However, working with the Unity Learn team was a great experience. The team behind developing and maintaining Unity Learn was incredibly supportive throughout our entire project, and took our study outcomes and data into consideration during recent iterations of their platform.</div></div></div></div></div></section><script src="js/jquery.js?site=6722ccc152ca0bf5a74acb9d" type="text/javascript"  ></script><script src="js/webflow.schunk.4a394eb5af8156f2.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="js/webflow-script.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
